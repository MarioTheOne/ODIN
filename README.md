# ODIN (Outlier Detection on Information Networks)

This project provides a set of algorithms and tools to perform anomaly
detection on complex networks. The project is experimental in nature and
stability is not one of its main goals at the moment.

Due to compatibility issues between NetworkX 1.x and 2.x, the old code
compatible with NetworkX 1.x can be found in the folder odin_nx1, while
the new code is in odin_nx2
