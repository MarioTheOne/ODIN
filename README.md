# ODIN (Outlier Detection on Information Networks)

This project provides a set of algorithms and tools to perform anomaly
detection on complex networks. The project is experimental in nature and
stability is not one of its main goals at the moment.

WARNING: The project does not work with NetworkX 2.x and its being
migrated right now. The code compatible with NetworkX 1.x can be found
in the folder odin_nx1.

Dependencies:
